# ðŸ“€ Domain Structure

This document explains the domain structure design used in the CSNP Platform, including the purpose of key domain layers and how they interact.

---

## ðŸ§± Core Concepts

### Csnp.SeedWork.Domain

Contains foundational domain building blocks:

- `Entity<T>`: Base class for aggregate roots or entities with identity.
- `ValueObject`: Base class for value objects with equality based on content.
- `IDomainEvent`, `IEntityWithEvents`: Event publishing interfaces.
- `IAggregateRoot`: Marker interface for aggregates.

### Csnp.SharedKernel.Domain

Contains reusable domain concepts shared across bounded contexts:

- Common value objects like `EmailAddress`, `PhoneNumber`
- Domain-specific exceptions (e.g., `InvalidEmailException`)
- Domain validators (e.g., `EmailAddressValidator`)

> ðŸ“Œ Note: `SharedKernel` has no business rules. It should only hold logic that's **meaningfully shared**, not just utility.

## ðŸ”„ Folder Structure

```
shared/
â”œâ”€â”€ Csnp.SeedWork/           # DDD base abstractions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Domain/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Entity.cs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ValueObject.cs

â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ IDomainEvent.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ Csnp.SharedKernel/       # Shared domain logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Domain/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ValueObjects/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ EmailAddress.cs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Exceptions/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ InvalidEmailException.cs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Validators/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ EmailAddressValidator.cs
```

## ðŸ§  Design Rationale

- **Csnp.SeedWork** enables reusable, framework-agnostic DDD patterns.
- **Csnp.SharedKernel** reduces duplication and enforces shared semantics across bounded contexts.
- Both `shared/` projects are **domain-level** and free of infrastructure concerns.

---

## âœ… Best Practices

- Keep logic minimal and reusable.
- Don't introduce infrastructure dependencies.
- Avoid bloating SharedKernel â€” only move shared business concepts.

Let your domain speak clearly. Keep your building blocks lean and purposeful ðŸ’¡
