## 1. Role-based Permissions

### üë®‚Äçüíª Developer (Member)
**Can do:**
- Create and work on working branches (feature/, bugfix/)
- Commit and push code to working branches
- Create PR/MR to merge into `dev`
- Review other members' code
- Sync and rebase from `dev` branch

**Cannot do:**
- Merge directly into environment branches
- Create hotfix branches (unless assigned)
- Merge into `uat`, `stg`, `pro`
- Delete environment branches

### üë®‚Äçüíª Senior Developer
**Can do (includes Developer permissions):**
- Merge PR/MR into `dev` and `uat`
- Create and handle hotfix branches
- Lead code review for complex features
- Approve deployment to UAT environment

**Cannot do:**
- Merge directly into `stg` and `pro`
- Create release tags
- Approve production deployment

### üë®‚Äçüíª Tech Lead
**Can do (includes all above permissions):**
- Merge into all environment branches
- Create and manage release tags
- Approve deployment to Staging and Production
- Manage branching strategy and process
- Force push in emergency cases (with documentation)

## 2. Branch Structure

### Environment Branches
- **`dev`**: Development environment - internal development and testing
- **`uat`**: User Acceptance Testing environment - testing with users
- **`stg`**: Staging environment - pre-production testing
- **`pro`**: Production environment - live system

### Working Branches
- **`feature/`**: New feature development
- **`hotfix/`**: Emergency fixes on production
- **`bugfix/`**: Bug fixes on environments
- **`refactor/`**: Code refactoring

## 2. Branch Naming Convention

### Standard format:
```
<type>/<ticket-id>-<brief-description>-<member-name>
```

### Examples:
- `feature/CSNP-123-user-authentication-ToanNV`
- `bugfix/CSNP-456-fix-login-error-MinhL`
- `hotfix/CSNP-789-critical-payment-bug-AnhPT`
- `refactor/CSNP-101-optimize-database-HungNQ`

### Rules:
- Use lowercase and hyphens for type and description
- Include ticket ID from project management system
- Brief description of purpose
- **Member name**: Capitalize first letters (e.g.: ToanNV, MinhL)
- Member name format: FirstName initial + LastName initial (e.g.: Nguyen Van Toan ‚Üí ToanNV, Le Minh ‚Üí MinhL)

## 3. Commit Message Convention

### Conventional Commits format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <ticket-id> <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Commit types:
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code format changes (no logic impact)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Add or fix tests
- **chore**: Update build system, dependencies

### Example:
```
feat(auth): add JWT token validation

- Implement JWT middleware for protected routes
- Add token expiration handling
- Update user authentication flow

Closes #123
```

## 4. Git Clone and Directory Naming Rules

### Directory naming format:
```
<repository-name>_<branch-name>
```

### Repository clone examples:
```bash
# Clone specific branch and name directory
git clone --branch document https://github.com/zngtfy/Interview.git Interview_document

# Clone other branches
git clone --branch dev https://github.com/company/project.git Project_dev
git clone --branch feature/login-ToanNV https://github.com/company/project.git Project_feature-login-ToanNV
git clone --branch uat https://github.com/company/project.git Project_uat
```

### Directory naming rules:
- **Repository name**: Keep original name
- **Branch name**: Replace `/` with `-` to avoid filesystem errors
- **Separator**: Use `_` between repo name and branch name
- **Case**: Keep original case of repository and branch name

### Special cases:
```bash
# Branch with slashes
git clone --branch feature/user-auth-ToanNV https://github.com/company/app.git App_feature-user-auth-ToanNV

# Branch with special characters
git clone --branch hotfix/fix-payment-issue-MinhL https://github.com/company/api.git Api_hotfix-fix-payment-issue-MinhL

# Environment branches
git clone --branch pro https://github.com/company/website.git Website_pro
```

### Benefits:
- **Easy identification**: Know immediately which branch you're working on
- **Avoid conflicts**: Multiple branches of same project don't have duplicate directory names
- **Organization**: Directories are sorted alphabetically
- **Team consistency**: Entire team uses consistent naming

## 5. Standard Workflow

### A. Starting work
```bash
# 1. Update dev branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

```

### Merge permissions:
- **dev**: Developer+ (after code review)
- **uat**: Senior Developer+
- **stg**: Tech Lead only
- **pro**: Tech Lead only

### Deployment workflow:
1. **Development**: Developer creates feature ‚Üí Senior reviews ‚Üí merge into `dev`
2. **User Testing**: Senior deploys from `dev` ‚Üí `uat` for user testing
3. **Staging**: Tech Lead deploys from `uat` ‚Üí `stg` for pre-production testing
4. **Production**: Tech Lead deploys from `stg` ‚Üí `pro` to production

### Hotfix Process by role:
```bash
# üë®‚Äçüíª Developer: Only fix on dev
git checkout dev
git checkout -b hotfix/CSNP-999-fix-validation-ToanNV

# üë®‚Äçüíª Senior Developer: Fix on dev and uat
git checkout dev  # or uat
git checkout -b hotfix/CSNP-999-critical-fix-MinhL

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech Lead: Fix on any environment
git checkout pro  # or stg/uat/dev
git checkout -b hotfix/CSNP-999-security-fix-AnhPT

# Merge back to all environments (Tech Lead does this)
git checkout pro
git merge hotfix/CSNP-999-security-fix-AnhPT

git checkout stg
git merge pro

git checkout uat
git merge stg

git checkout dev
git merge uat
```

## 8. Release Process

### Semantic Versioning:
- **MAJOR**: Incompatible changes (Tech Lead decides)
- **MINOR**: New features (Senior+ proposes)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (Developer+ can propose)

### Release process by role:

# No permission to create tags
```

#### üë®‚Äçüíª Senior Developer:
```bash
# Can propose minor/patch version
# Prepare release notes
# Review release impact
```

#### üë®‚Äçüíª Tech Lead:
```bash
# Create tag from pro branch
git checkout pro
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0

# Update changelog
git commit -m "chore(release): update changelog for v1.2.0"

# Ensure sync back to dev
git checkout dev
git merge pro
```

### Environment Deployment Schedule:
- **dev**: Continuous deployment (Developer merge)

### Sensitive Data:
- No committing passwords, API keys
- Use `.gitignore` for config files
- Use environment variables for each environment
- Separate config files for each environment
- Secret management only Tech Lead and Senior have access

## 9. Tools and Automation

### Pre-commit Hooks:
```bash
# Install pre-commit
npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged

# package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.js": ["eslint --fix", "git add"]
  }
}
```

### CI/CD Integration:
- Automated testing on every PR
- Build and deploy automation
- Code quality checks (SonarQube, CodeClimate)

## 10. Best Practices

### DO:
- Commit small and frequently
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Rebase before merge (for clean history)
- Use .gitignore effectively
- Backup important branches

### DON'T:
- Commit untested code
- Force push to shared branches
- Commit large binary files
- Use `git add .` without checking
- Ignore conflict resolution

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Rollback commits:
```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo commit and delete changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert commit (create new commit)
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Resolve conflicts:
```bash
# During merge/rebase
git status
# Fix conflicts in files
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue
```

## 13. Monitoring and Metrics

### Environment monitoring:
- **dev**: Commit frequency, build success rate (Developer monitors)
- **uat**: Bug detection rate, user feedback (Senior Developer monitors)
